    "\n",
    "Remember how I said we would learn more about objects back in notebook 2? Well here we are, so brace yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we've done so far is called **procedural programming**, where we organize code around a particular task or tasks. This is a pretty natural way to think about programming, especially as scientists who are often using code to perform sequential analyses. First we might write some code that will reformat our data, then we would graphically display the data for exploration, then we might write more code to trim any outliers before we finally feed our data into some sort of model. Step after step, each chunk of code is defined by the overall process we wish to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another coding style emerged in the 80's and 90's and has gained prominence since then called **object orientation**. Instead of organizing code by tasks, object orientation tries to organize code such that it is associated around code belonging to similar concepts or things. Instead of storing a bunch of student names in a list and a bunch of student ID numbers in a separate list, object oriented programming would create a student object type and then associate ID and Name strings with that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merits of each style have been argued by people way smarter than me, so can develop a preference for whatever you like. However, given the ubiquity of objects in today's programs it's important to at least learn the basics. Also, as Python is an object-oriented language, **everything** in Python is an object; every variable, function, method, class, type, module, package, etc. are treated as objects. "
